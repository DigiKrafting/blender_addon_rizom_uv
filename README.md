# Blender Addon RizomUV

Bridge/Pipeline/Workflow import/export for RizomUV.

# Features

- One click RizomUV FBX Export (Exports selected object to export folder and opens file in RizomUV)
- One click RizomUV FBX Import (Imports exported FBX and transfers UV data on selected object)

# Required Blender Version

blender_addon_rizom_uv 0.1.1+

2.80.0

Prior to blender_addon_rizom_uv 0.1.1

2.79.0
\* Will likely work in previous versions but untested.

# IMPORTANT USAGE NOTES 

\* Make sure you have a saved .blend file before using the auto import/export features, then saving before import/export is then not required. The addon needs the file location to know where to create the export folder used for import/export of the files.

- File Naming Convention

    File names are derived from the selected object name or your blender file name.
