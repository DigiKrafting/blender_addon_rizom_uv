# Blender Addon Unfold3D

Bridge/Pipeline/Workflow import/export for Unfold3D.

# Features

- One click Unfold3D OBJ Export (Exports selected object to export folder and opens file in Unfold3D)
- One click Unfold3D OBJ Import (Imports exported obj and transfer UV data on selected object)

# Required Blender Version

2.79.0

\* Will likely work in previous versions but untested.

# IMPORTANT USAGE NOTES 

\* Make sure you have a saved .blend file before using the auto import/export features, then saving before import/export is then not required. The addon needs the file location to know where to create the export folder used for import/export of the files.

- File Naming Convention

    File names are derived from the selected object name or your blender file name.
